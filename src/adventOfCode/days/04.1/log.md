Here is a coding problem:

Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.

However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).

For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:

2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8

For the first few pairs, this list means:

    Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).
    The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.
    The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.

This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:

.234.....  2-4
.....678.  6-8

.23......  2-3
...45....  4-5

....567..  5-7
......789  7-9

.2345678.  2-8
..34567..  3-7

.....6...  6-6
...456...  4-6

.23456...  2-6
...45678.  4-8

Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are 2 such pairs.

In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Parse the input: First, we need to parse the input and convert it into a more manageable data structure. We can represent each pair of section assignments as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end section IDs for each Elf's assignment.

2. Check for containment: For each pair of section assignments, we need to check if one range fully contains the other. To do this, we can compare the start and end section IDs of both assignments in the pair. If the start section ID of one assignment is greater than or equal to the start section ID of the other assignment, and the end section ID of the first assignment is less than or equal to the end section ID of the other assignment, then one range fully contains the other.

3. Count the pairs: We need to keep track of the number of pairs where one range fully contains the other. We can use a counter variable to store this count. For each pair of section assignments, if one range fully contains the other, increment the counter.

4. Return the result: After iterating through all the pairs of section assignments, return the counter variable as the final result.

Here's the reasoning for the given example:

- For the first pair (2-4, 6-8), neither range contains the other.
- For the second pair (2-3, 4-5), neither range contains the other.
- For the third pair (5-7, 7-9), neither range contains the other.
- For the fourth pair (2-8, 3-7), 2-8 fully contains 3-7, so we increment the counter.
- For the fifth pair (6-6, 4-6), 4-6 fully contains 6-6, so we increment the counter.
- For the sixth pair (2-6, 4-8), neither range contains the other.

The final result is 2, as there are 2 pairs where one range fully contains the other.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve  using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`


Your solution should print console.log statements to help me understand what is happening as the code runs.

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
// Import required modules
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

// Parse the input
const parseInput = (input: string): [number, number][][] => {
  return input
    .split('\n')
    .filter((line) => line.trim() !== '')
    .map((line) => {
      const [range1, range2] = line.split(',');
      const [start1, end1] = range1.split('-').map(Number);
      const [start2, end2] = range2.split('-').map(Number);
      return [
        [start1, end1],
        [start2, end2],
      ];
    });
};

// Check if one range fully contains the other
const contains = (range1: [number, number], range2: [number, number]): boolean => {
  return (
    (range1[0] >= range2[0] && range1[1] <= range2[1]) ||
    (range2[0] >= range1[0] && range2[1] <= range1[1])
  );
};

// Count the pairs where one range fully contains the other
const countPairs = (pairs: [number, number][][]): number => {
  let count = 0;
  for (const pair of pairs) {
    console.log(`Checking pair: ${pair[0]} - ${pair[1]}`);
    if (contains(pair[0], pair[1])) {
      console.log(`One range fully contains the other in pair: ${pair[0]} - ${pair[1]}`);
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};

// Main function to solve the puzzle
const main = () => {
  const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
  const pairs = parseInput(input);
  const answer = countPairs(pairs);
  console.log('\n', answer);
};

main();
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the previous explanation. It first reads the input file using the provided `readRelativeInput` function, then parses the input into a list of pairs of section assignments. The `contains` function checks if one range fully contains the other, and the `countPairs` function iterates through the pairs and counts the number of pairs where one range fully contains the other. The main function ties everything together and prints the answer to the puzzle.
