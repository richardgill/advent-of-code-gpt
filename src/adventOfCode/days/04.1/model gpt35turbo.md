Here is a coding problem:

Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.

However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).

For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:

2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8

For the first few pairs, this list means:

    Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).
    The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.
    The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.

This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:

.234.....  2-4
.....678.  6-8

.23......  2-3
...45....  4-5

....567..  5-7
......789  7-9

.2345678.  2-8
..34567..  3-7

.....6...  6-6
...456...  4-6

.23456...  2-6
...45678.  4-8

Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are 2 such pairs.

In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?

Step 1: Parse the input
The first step is to parse the input and store the section assignments as pairs of integers. We can split each line of the input by the comma separator, and then split each part by the dash separator to get the start and end of each section assignment.

Step 2: Check for containment
For each pair of section assignments, we need to check if one fully contains the other. We can do this by comparing the start and end values of each assignment. If one assignment starts and ends within the range of the other assignment, then it is fully contained.

Step 3: Count the number of contained pairs
We can keep a count of the number of pairs where one assignment fully contains the other. If we find a pair where one assignment fully contains the other, we increment the count.

Step 4: Return the count
After checking all pairs of section assignments, we return the count of pairs where one assignment fully contains the other.

Overall, the solution involves parsing the input, checking for containment, counting the number of contained pairs, and returning the count.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve  using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`


Your solution should print console.log statements to help me understand what is happening as the code runs.

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's the solution to the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}

const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt')

const sectionAssignments = input.trim().split('\n').map(line => {
  const [start, end] = line.split(',').map(part => parseInt(part.split('-')[0]))
  return [start, end]
})

let count = 0

for (let i = 0; i < sectionAssignments.length; i++) {
  const [start1, end1] = sectionAssignments[i]
  for (let j = i + 1; j < sectionAssignments.length; j++) {
    const [start2, end2] = sectionAssignments[j]
    if ((start1 <= start2 && end1 >= end2) || (start2 <= start1 && end2 >= end1)) {
      console.log(`Section assignment ${i} (${start1}-${end1}) fully contains section assignment ${j} (${start2}-${end2})`)
      count++
    }
  }
}

console.log('\n', count)
```

Explanation:

First, we use the `readRelativeInput` function to read the puzzle input from the `./data/puzzleInput.txt` file.

Next, we parse the input into an array of section assignments, where each assignment is represented as a pair of integers.

Then, we loop through each pair of section assignments and check if one fully contains the other. If we find a pair where one assignment fully contains the other, we log a message to the console and increment the count.

Finally, we print the count of pairs where one assignment fully contains the other to the console.

To run the solution, we can use the following command:

```
deno run --allow-read index.ts
```

This will output the number of pairs where one assignment fully contains the other.

    parseInt(part.split("-")[0])
