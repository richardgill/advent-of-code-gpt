Here is a coding problem I am trying to solve:

The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a tree house.

First, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house hidden. To do this, you need to count the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid when looking directly along a row or column.

The Elves have already launched a quadcopter to generate a map with the height of each tree (your puzzle input). For example:

30373
25512
65332
33549
35390

Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where 0 is the shortest and 9 is the tallest.

A tree is visible if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are shorter than it. Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.

All of the trees around the edge of the grid are visible - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view. In this example, that only leaves the interior nine trees to consider:

    The top-left 5 is visible from the left and top. (It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height 5 are in the way.)
    The top-middle 5 is visible from the top and right.
    The top-right 1 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height 0 between it and an edge.
    The left-middle 5 is visible, but only from the right.
    The center 3 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height 2 between it and an edge.
    The right-middle 3 is visible from the right.
    In the bottom row, the middle 5 is visible, but the 3 and 4 are not.

With 16 trees visible on the edge and another 5 visible in the interior, a total of 21 trees are visible in this arrangement.

Consider your map; how many trees are visible from outside the grid?


You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const countVisibleTrees = (grid: string[][]) => {
  let visibleTrees = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
      const currentTree = parseInt(grid[i][j]);

      const left = grid[i].slice(0, j).every(tree => parseInt(tree) < currentTree);
      const right = grid[i].slice(j + 1).every(tree => parseInt(tree) < currentTree);
      const up = grid.slice(0, i).every(row => parseInt(row[j]) < currentTree);
      const down = grid.slice(i + 1).every(row => parseInt(row[j]) < currentTree);

      if (left || right || up || down) {
        visibleTrees++;
      }
    }
  }

  return visibleTrees;
};

const main = () => {
  const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
  const grid = input.trim().split('\n').map(line => line.split(''));

  const answer = countVisibleTrees(grid);
  console.log('\n', answer);
};

main();
```

This solution defines a `countVisibleTrees` function that takes a 2D array of strings representing the grid of trees. It iterates through each tree in the grid and checks if it's visible from any direction (left, right, up, or down). If a tree is visible from any direction, it increments the `visibleTrees` counter. Finally, it returns the total number of visible trees.

The `main` function reads the puzzle input, converts it into a 2D array, and calls `countVisibleTrees` with the grid. It then prints the answer on a new line.
