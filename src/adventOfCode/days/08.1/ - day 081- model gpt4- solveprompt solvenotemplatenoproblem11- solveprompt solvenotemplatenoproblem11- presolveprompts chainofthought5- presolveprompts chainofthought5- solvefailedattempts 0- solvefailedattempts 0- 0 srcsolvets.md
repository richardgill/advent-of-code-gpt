Here is a coding problem:

The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a tree house.

First, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house hidden. To do this, you need to count the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid when looking directly along a row or column.

The Elves have already launched a quadcopter to generate a map with the height of each tree (your puzzle input). For example:

30373
25512
65332
33549
35390

Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where 0 is the shortest and 9 is the tallest.

A tree is visible if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are shorter than it. Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.

All of the trees around the edge of the grid are visible - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view. In this example, that only leaves the interior nine trees to consider:

    The top-left 5 is visible from the left and top. (It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height 5 are in the way.)
    The top-middle 5 is visible from the top and right.
    The top-right 1 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height 0 between it and an edge.
    The left-middle 5 is visible, but only from the right.
    The center 3 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height 2 between it and an edge.
    The right-middle 3 is visible from the right.
    In the bottom row, the middle 5 is visible, but the 3 and 4 are not.

With 16 trees visible on the edge and another 5 visible in the interior, a total of 21 trees are visible in this arrangement.

Consider your map; how many trees are visible from outside the grid?


Please explain an approach you could use to solve  the problem. Explain how the solution works and break the small steps involved.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `visible_trees` to store the count of visible trees. Set its initial value to the number of trees on the edges of the grid, as they are always visible.

2. Iterate through the interior trees (i.e., not on the edges) in the grid using nested loops. For each tree, check its visibility in all four directions (up, down, left, and right).

3. To check the visibility in each direction, we can use the following approach:
   - For the upward direction, iterate through the trees in the same column above the current tree. If all the trees above the current tree have a height less than the current tree's height, then the current tree is visible from the top.
   - Similarly, for the downward direction, iterate through the trees in the same column below the current tree. If all the trees below the current tree have a height less than the current tree's height, then the current tree is visible from the bottom.
   - For the leftward direction, iterate through the trees in the same row to the left of the current tree. If all the trees to the left of the current tree have a height less than the current tree's height, then the current tree is visible from the left.
   - For the rightward direction, iterate through the trees in the same row to the right of the current tree. If all the trees to the right of the current tree have a height less than the current tree's height, then the current tree is visible from the right.

4. If a tree is visible from any direction, increment the `visible_trees` counter.

5. After iterating through all the interior trees, the `visible_trees` counter will have the total number of visible trees from outside the grid.

6. Return the `visible_trees` counter as the final answer.

By following this approach, we can efficiently determine the number of trees visible from outside the grid. The solution works by checking the visibility of each interior tree in all four directions and counting the visible trees.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const countVisibleTrees = (grid: string[]): number => {
  const rows = grid.length;
  const cols = grid[0].length;
  let visibleTrees = 0;

  // Count edge trees
  visibleTrees += 2 * (rows + cols) - 4;

  // Check visibility of interior trees
  for (let i = 1; i < rows - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < cols - 1; j++) {
      const currentHeight = parseInt(grid[i][j], 10);
      let visible = false;

      // Check upward direction
      visible = grid.slice(0, i).every(row => parseInt(row[j], 10) < currentHeight);
      if (!visible) {
        // Check downward direction
        visible = grid.slice(i + 1).every(row => parseInt(row[j], 10) < currentHeight);
      }
      if (!visible) {
        // Check leftward direction
        visible = grid[i].slice(0, j).split('').every(tree => parseInt(tree, 10) < currentHeight);
      }
      if (!visible) {
        // Check rightward direction
        visible = grid[i].slice(j + 1).split('').every(tree => parseInt(tree, 10) < currentHeight);
      }

      if (visible) {
        visibleTrees++;
      }
    }
  }

  return visibleTrees;
};

const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
const grid = puzzleInput.trim().split('\n');
const answer = countVisibleTrees(grid);
console.log('\n', answer);
```

This solution first reads the puzzle input from the file and then uses the `countVisibleTrees` function to calculate the number of visible trees. Finally, it prints the answer on a new line.
