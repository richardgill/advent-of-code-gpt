Here is a coding problem:

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.

However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?


Please explain 3-5 small steps to solve  the problem. Show your reasoning and explain your answer.

assistant: 

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable, say `count`, to store the number of characters processed so far. Set its initial value to 0.

2. Create a sliding window of size 4 to keep track of the most recent four characters in the datastream buffer. Initialize it with the first four characters of the buffer.

3. Check if all the characters in the sliding window are distinct. If they are, the start-of-packet marker is found, and we can return the value of `count` + 1 (as the marker is complete after `count` + 1 characters have been processed).

4. If the characters in the sliding window are not distinct, move the window one character to the right (i.e., remove the first character of the window and add the next character from the buffer). Increment the `count` variable by 1.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the start-of-packet marker is found or the end of the buffer is reached.

For example, let's consider the datastream buffer: mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

1. Initialize `count` to 0.
2. Initialize the sliding window with the first four characters: mjqj
3. Check if all characters in the window are distinct. They are not (j is repeated), so move the window one character to the right: jqjp
4. Increment `count` by 1: count = 1
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4:
   - Window: jqjp, not distinct, move to the right: qjpq, count = 2
   - Window: qjpq, not distinct, move to the right: jpqm, count = 3
   - Window: jpqm, all characters are distinct, return count + 1 = 4

The first start-of-packet marker is detected after processing 4 characters.

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
// Import required modules
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

// Function to read input file
const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

// Function to find the first start-of-packet marker
const findFirstMarker = (datastream: string): number => {
  let count = 0;
  let window = datastream.slice(0, 4);

  while (new Set(window).size !== 4) {
    count++;
    window = datastream.slice(count, count + 4);
  }

  return count + 1;
};

// Read the puzzle input
const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');

// Find the answer to the puzzle
const answer = findFirstMarker(puzzleInput);

// Print the answer
console.log('\n', answer);
```

This script first imports the required modules and defines the `readRelativeInput` function to read the input file. Then, it defines the `findFirstMarker` function to find the first start-of-packet marker in the datastream buffer.

After reading the puzzle input using the `readRelativeInput` function, the script calls the `findFirstMarker` function to find the answer to the puzzle and prints it on a new line.
