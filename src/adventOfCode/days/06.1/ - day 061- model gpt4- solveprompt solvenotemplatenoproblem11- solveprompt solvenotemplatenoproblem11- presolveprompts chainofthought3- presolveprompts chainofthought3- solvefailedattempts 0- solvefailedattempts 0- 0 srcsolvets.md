Here is a coding problem:

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.

However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?


Please explain a step by step algorithm to solve  the problem.

Please explain a step by step algorithm to solve  the problem.

assistant: 

Here's a step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize a variable, say `position`, to store the position of the first start-of-packet marker. Set its initial value to 0.

2. Initialize a variable, say `buffer_length`, to store the length of the datastream buffer.

3. Iterate through the datastream buffer using a loop. For each character in the buffer, perform the following steps:

   a. Increment the `position` variable by 1.
   
   b. Check if the current position is greater than or equal to 4. If not, continue to the next iteration of the loop. This is because we need at least 4 characters to form a start-of-packet marker.
   
   c. Extract the last 4 characters from the buffer, starting from the current position. You can use slicing or any other method to achieve this.
   
   d. Check if all the characters in the extracted 4-character sequence are unique. You can use a set data structure to achieve this. If the length of the set is equal to 4, it means all characters are unique, and we have found the first start-of-packet marker.
   
   e. If the first start-of-packet marker is found, break the loop and return the `position` variable as the result.

4. If the loop completes without finding a start-of-packet marker, return -1 to indicate that no marker was found in the datastream buffer.

Here's a Python implementation of the algorithm:

```python
def find_first_marker(datastream):
    position = 0
    buffer_length = len(datastream)

    for char in datastream:
        position += 1

        if position >= 4:
            last_four_chars = datastream[position-4:position]
            unique_chars = set(last_four_chars)

            if len(unique_chars) == 4:
                return position

    return -1
```

You can use this function to find the first start-of-packet marker in the given datastream buffers:

```python
print(find_first_marker("mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb"))  # Output: 7
print(find_first_marker("bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz"))  # Output: 5
print(find_first_marker("nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg"))  # Output: 6
print(find_first_marker("nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg"))  # Output: 10
print(find_first_marker("zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw"))  # Output: 11
```

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution to the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

1. Create a new TypeScript file, say `main.ts`.

2. Add the following imports and the `readRelativeInput` function:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};
```

3. Define the `findFirstMarker` function:

```typescript
const findFirstMarker = (datastream: string): number => {
  let position = 0;
  const bufferLength = datastream.length;

  for (const char of datastream) {
    position += 1;

    if (position >= 4) {
      const lastFourChars = datastream.slice(position - 4, position);
      const uniqueChars = new Set(lastFourChars);

      if (uniqueChars.size === 4) {
        return position;
      }
    }
  }

  return -1;
};
```

4. Read the puzzle input from the file and call the `findFirstMarker` function:

```typescript
const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
const answer = findFirstMarker(puzzleInput);
console.log('\n', answer);
```

5. Save the file and run the solution using Deno:

```bash
deno run --allow-read main.ts
```

This will print the answer to the puzzle on a new line.
