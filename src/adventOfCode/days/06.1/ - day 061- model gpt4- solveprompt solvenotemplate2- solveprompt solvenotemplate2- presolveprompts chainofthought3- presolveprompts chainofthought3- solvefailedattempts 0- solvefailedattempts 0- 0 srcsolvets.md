Here is a coding problem:

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.

However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?


Please explain a step by step algorithm to solve  the problem.

Please explain a step by step algorithm to solve  the problem.

Here's a step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize a variable, say `position`, to store the current position in the datastream buffer. Set its initial value to 0.

2. Initialize a variable, say `buffer_length`, to store the length of the datastream buffer. Calculate its value using the length of the input string.

3. Create a function, say `is_marker()`, that takes a string of 4 characters as input and returns True if all characters are different, and False otherwise. You can implement this function by converting the input string to a set and checking if the length of the set is equal to 4.

4. Iterate through the datastream buffer using a while loop. The loop should continue until the value of `position` is less than `buffer_length - 3`. Inside the loop, perform the following steps:

    a. Extract a substring of 4 characters from the datastream buffer, starting at the current `position`.

    b. Check if the extracted substring is a start-of-packet marker by calling the `is_marker()` function. If it returns True, break the loop, as we have found the first marker.

    c. If the `is_marker()` function returns False, increment the `position` by 1 to move to the next character in the datastream buffer.

5. After the loop ends, the value of `position` will be the position of the first start-of-packet marker. Add 4 to the `position` to get the number of characters processed before the first marker is detected.

6. Return the final value of `position` as the result.

Here's a Python implementation of the algorithm:

```python
def is_marker(substring):
    return len(set(substring)) == 4

def find_first_marker(datastream):
    position = 0
    buffer_length = len(datastream)

    while position < buffer_length - 3:
        substring = datastream[position:position + 4]
        if is_marker(substring):
            break
        position += 1

    return position + 4
```

You can now call the `find_first_marker()` function with the given datastream buffers to get the desired results.

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

To solve the problem using Deno and TypeScript, follow these steps:

1. Create a new TypeScript file, say `solution.ts`.

2. Import the necessary modules at the beginning of the file:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';
```

3. Add the `readRelativeInput` function to read the input file:

```typescript
const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};
```

4. Implement the `isMarker` and `findFirstMarker` functions as described in the previous answer, but with TypeScript types:

```typescript
const isMarker = (substring: string): boolean => {
  return new Set(substring).size === 4;
};

const findFirstMarker = (datastream: string): number => {
  let position = 0;
  const bufferLength = datastream.length;

  while (position < bufferLength - 3) {
    const substring = datastream.slice(position, position + 4);
    if (isMarker(substring)) {
      break;
    }
    position += 1;
  }

  return position + 4;
};
```

5. Read the puzzle input from the `./data/puzzleInput.txt` file:

```typescript
const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
```

6. Call the `findFirstMarker` function with the puzzle input and store the result in a variable, say `answer`:

```typescript
const answer = findFirstMarker(puzzleInput);
```

7. Print the answer to the puzzle on a new line:

```typescript
console.log('\n', answer);
```

8. Save the `solution.ts` file and run it using Deno:

```bash
deno run --allow-read solution.ts
```

This will print the answer to the puzzle.
