Here is a coding problem:

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.

However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?


Please explain 3 different approaches you could use to solve  the problem. For each approach explain how the solution works and break the small steps involved.

assistant: 

Approach 1: Sliding Window
1. Initialize a variable `window` to store the most recent four characters.
2. Iterate through the datastream buffer.
3. For each character, add it to the `window` and remove the oldest character if the window size is greater than 4.
4. Check if all characters in the `window` are unique. If they are, return the current index + 1 (since the index is 0-based).
5. If the loop ends without finding a marker, return -1 (or an appropriate error message).

This approach works by maintaining a "sliding window" of the most recent four characters. It checks if the characters in the window are unique, and if so, returns the position of the marker. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the datastream buffer.

Approach 2: Using a Set
1. Initialize a variable `unique_chars` as an empty set.
2. Iterate through the datastream buffer.
3. For each character, add it to the `unique_chars` set.
4. If the size of `unique_chars` is 4, return the current index + 1 (since the index is 0-based).
5. If the size of `unique_chars` is greater than 4, remove the oldest character from the set and continue the loop.
6. If the loop ends without finding a marker, return -1 (or an appropriate error message).

This approach works by using a set to store the unique characters. It checks if the size of the set is 4, and if so, returns the position of the marker. The time complexity of this approach is also O(n), where n is the length of the datastream buffer.

Approach 3: Brute Force
1. Iterate through the datastream buffer with a loop that starts at index 0 and ends at index n-4, where n is the length of the datastream buffer.
2. For each index, check if the current character and the next three characters are all different.
3. If they are, return the current index + 4 (since the index is 0-based and we want the position after the marker).
4. If the loop ends without finding a marker, return -1 (or an appropriate error message).

This approach works by checking every possible four-character sequence in the datastream buffer. It has a higher time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, as it needs to check all possible combinations of four characters. However, it does not require any additional data structures like the other two approaches.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution using Deno and TypeScript with the sliding window approach:

```typescript
// Import path module from Deno standard library
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const findMarkerPosition = (datastream: string): number => {
  let window: string[] = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < datastream.length; i++) {
    window.push(datastream[i]);
    if (window.length > 4) {
      window.shift();
    }

    if (new Set(window).size === 4) {
      return i + 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
};

const main = () => {
  const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
  const answer = findMarkerPosition(puzzleInput);
  console.log('\n', answer);
};

main();
```

This script reads the puzzle input from the `./data/puzzleInput.txt` file, finds the position of the first start-of-packet marker using the `findMarkerPosition` function, and prints the answer to the console.
