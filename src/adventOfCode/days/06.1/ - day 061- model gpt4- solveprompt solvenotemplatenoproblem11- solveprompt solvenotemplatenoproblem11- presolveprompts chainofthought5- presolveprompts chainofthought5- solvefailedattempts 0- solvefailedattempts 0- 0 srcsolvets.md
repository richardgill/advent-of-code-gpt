Here is a coding problem:

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.

However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?


Please explain an approach you could use to solve  the problem. Explain how the solution works and break the small steps involved.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. The solution works by maintaining a window of size 4 and checking if all characters in the window are distinct. If they are, we have found the start-of-packet marker, and we can return the position. If not, we slide the window one character to the right and repeat the process.

Here are the steps involved in the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `position` to store the current position in the datastream buffer, starting at 0.

2. Create a function `is_distinct` that takes a string of length 4 as input and returns True if all characters in the string are distinct, and False otherwise. This can be done by converting the string to a set and checking if the length of the set is equal to 4.

3. Create a loop that iterates through the datastream buffer. In each iteration, perform the following steps:

   a. Check if the current position is greater than or equal to the length of the datastream buffer minus 3. If it is, break the loop, as we cannot form a window of size 4 anymore.
   
   b. Extract a substring of length 4 from the datastream buffer, starting at the current position.
   
   c. Call the `is_distinct` function with the extracted substring as input. If the function returns True, we have found the start-of-packet marker, and we can return the current position plus 4 (as the position is 0-indexed and we want the position after the marker).
   
   d. If the function returns False, increment the position by 1 and continue with the next iteration.

4. If the loop finishes without finding a start-of-packet marker, return -1 to indicate that no marker was found.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the datastream buffer, as we are iterating through the buffer once and performing constant-time operations in each iteration.

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution to the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
// Import required modules
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

// Read input file
const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

// Check if a string of length 4 has distinct characters
const isDistinct = (s: string): boolean => {
  return new Set(s).size === 4;
};

// Find the position of the first start-of-packet marker
const findMarkerPosition = (datastream: string): number => {
  let position = 0;

  while (position <= datastream.length - 4) {
    const window = datastream.slice(position, position + 4);

    if (isDistinct(window)) {
      return position + 4;
    }

    position++;
  }

  return -1;
};

// Read the puzzle input and solve the problem
const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
const answer = findMarkerPosition(puzzleInput);

// Print the answer
console.log('\n', answer);
```

This solution follows the approach explained earlier. It first reads the puzzle input using the provided `readRelativeInput` function. Then, it defines the `isDistinct` function to check if a string of length 4 has distinct characters and the `findMarkerPosition` function to find the position of the first start-of-packet marker in the datastream. Finally, it calls the `findMarkerPosition` function with the puzzle input and prints the answer.
