Here is a coding problem:

Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.

However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).

For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:

2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8

For the first few pairs, this list means:

    Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).
    The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.
    The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.

This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:

.234.....  2-4
.....678.  6-8

.23......  2-3
...45....  4-5

....567..  5-7
......789  7-9

.2345678.  2-8
..34567..  3-7

.....6...  6-6
...456...  4-6

.23456...  2-6
...45678.  4-8

Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are 2 such pairs.

In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?

Your puzzle answer was 644.
--- Part Two ---

It seems like there is still quite a bit of duplicate work planned. Instead, the Elves would like to know the number of pairs that overlap at all.

In the above example, the first two pairs (2-4,6-8 and 2-3,4-5) don't overlap, while the remaining four pairs (5-7,7-9, 2-8,3-7, 6-6,4-6, and 2-6,4-8) do overlap:

    5-7,7-9 overlaps in a single section, 7.
    2-8,3-7 overlaps all of the sections 3 through 7.
    6-6,4-6 overlaps in a single section, 6.
    2-6,4-8 overlaps in sections 4, 5, and 6.

So, in this example, the number of overlapping assignment pairs is 4.

In how many assignment pairs do the ranges overlap?

To solve part 2 of the problem, follow these steps:

1. Parse the input: First, we need to parse the input and convert it into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two tuples representing the section assignments for each Elf in the pair. For example, the input "2-4,6-8" would be converted to ((2, 4), (6, 8)).

2. Check for overlaps: Create a function that takes two section assignments (tuples) and checks if they overlap. Two section assignments overlap if the start of one assignment is within the range of the other assignment or vice versa. For example, (2, 4) and (6, 8) do not overlap, while (5, 7) and (7, 9) do overlap.

3. Count overlapping pairs: Iterate through the list of section assignment pairs and use the function created in step 2 to check if the assignments in each pair overlap. If they do, increment a counter. After iterating through all the pairs, the counter will hold the number of overlapping assignment pairs.

Here's the reasoning behind the solution:

- We need to parse the input to work with the section assignments in a more convenient format (tuples).
- To find overlapping pairs, we need a function that can determine if two section assignments overlap.
- Finally, we need to iterate through all the pairs and count the number of overlapping pairs using the function from step 2.

After implementing these steps, the answer to part 2 of the problem will be the final value of the counter, which represents the number of overlapping assignment pairs.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve part 2 of using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`


Your solution should print console.log statements to help me understand what is happening as the code runs.

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a Deno and TypeScript solution for part 2 of the problem:

```typescript
// Import required modules
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

// Read input file
const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

// Parse input
const parseInput = (input: string): [number, number][] => {
  return input
    .split('\n')
    .filter((line) => line.trim() !== '')
    .map((line) => {
      const [range1, range2] = line.split(',').map((range) => range.split('-').map(Number));
      return [range1, range2] as [number, number];
    });
};

// Check for overlaps
const isOverlap = (range1: [number, number], range2: [number, number]): boolean => {
  return range1[0] <= range2[1] && range1[1] >= range2[0];
};

// Count overlapping pairs
const countOverlappingPairs = (pairs: [number, number][]): number => {
  let count = 0;
  for (const [range1, range2] of pairs) {
    if (isOverlap(range1, range2)) {
      console.log(`Overlapping pair: ${range1}-${range2}`);
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};

// Main function
const main = () => {
  const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
  const pairs = parseInput(input);
  console.log('Parsed input:', pairs);

  const answer = countOverlappingPairs(pairs);
  console.log('\n', answer);
};

main();
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the previous answer. It first reads the input file using the provided `readRelativeInput` function. Then, it parses the input into a list of tuples using the `parseInput` function. The `isOverlap` function checks if two section assignments overlap, and the `countOverlappingPairs` function iterates through the list of section assignment pairs and counts the number of overlapping pairs.

The `main` function ties everything together, reading the input, parsing it, and counting the overlapping pairs. It also includes `console.log` statements to help you understand what's happening as the code runs. Finally, it prints the answer to the puzzle on a new line.
