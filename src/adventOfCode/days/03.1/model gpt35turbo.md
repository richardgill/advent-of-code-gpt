Here is a coding problem:

One Elf has the important job of loading all of the rucksacks with supplies for the jungle journey. Unfortunately, that Elf didn't quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.

Each rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.

The Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types of items).

The list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.

For example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:

vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw

    The first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p.
    The second rucksack's compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L.
    The third rucksack's compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P.
    The fourth rucksack's compartments only share item type v.
    The fifth rucksack's compartments only share item type t.
    The sixth rucksack's compartments only share item type s.

To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:

    Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
    Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.

In the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.

Find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?

Step 1: Read the input
Read the input which contains the list of contents from six rucksacks.

Step 2: Identify the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack
For each rucksack, identify the item type that appears in both compartments. If there is no item type that appears in both compartments, skip to the next rucksack. If there is more than one item type that appears in both compartments, skip to the next rucksack.

Step 3: Convert the item type to a priority
Convert the item type to a priority using the following rules:
- Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
- Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.

Step 4: Calculate the sum of priorities
Calculate the sum of priorities for all the item types that appear in both compartments of each rucksack.

Step 5: Output the result
Output the sum of priorities calculated in step 4 as the final result.

Overall, the solution involves parsing the input, identifying the item types that appear in both compartments of each rucksack, converting the item types to priorities, and calculating the sum of priorities.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve  using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`


Your solution should print console.log statements to help me understand what is happening as the code runs.

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's the solution to the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}

const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt').trim().split('\n')

const getPriority = (itemType: string): number => {
  const code = itemType.charCodeAt(0)
  if (code >= 97 && code <= 122) {
    return code - 96
  } else if (code >= 65 && code <= 90) {
    return code - 38
  }
  return 0
}

let sum = 0

for (const line of input) {
  const [compartment1, compartment2] = [line.slice(0, line.length / 2), line.slice(line.length / 2)]
  const commonItems = new Set(compartment1.split('').filter(item => compartment2.includes(item)))
  if (commonItems.size === 1) {
    const itemType = commonItems.values().next().value
    sum += getPriority(itemType)
  }
}

console.log('\n', sum)
```

Explanation:

- We first read the input file using the `readRelativeInput` function and split it into an array of strings representing the contents of each rucksack.
- We define a `getPriority` function that takes an item type as input and returns its priority based on the rules given in the problem statement.
- We then loop through each rucksack and split its contents into two compartments. We use a `Set` to find the item types that appear in both compartments and check if there is only one such item type. If there is, we add its priority to the `sum` variable.
- Finally, we output the `sum` variable as the answer to the puzzle.

To run the solution, save the code in a file named `solution.ts` and run the following command in the terminal:

```
deno run --allow-read solution.ts
```

The `--allow-read` flag is required to allow the script to read the input file.

  const filePath = path.join(dirname, "data", inputFile);
