Here is a coding problem:

The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.

The ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.

The Elves don't want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.

They do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:

    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2

In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.

Then, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:

[D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:

        [Z]
        [N]
    [C] [D]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3

Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved one at a time, crate C ends up below crate M:

        [Z]
        [N]
[M]     [D]
[C]     [P]
 1   2   3

Finally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:

        [Z]
        [N]
        [D]
[C] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

The Elves just need to know which crate will end up on top of each stack; in this example, the top crates are C in stack 1, M in stack 2, and Z in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message CMZ.

After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?

## completion 2 
assistant: 

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Parse the input: First, parse the input to create a data structure representing the initial stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure. For the stacks, you can use a list of lists, where each inner list represents a stack and contains the crates in order from bottom to top. For the rearrangement procedure, you can use a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of crates to move and the source and destination stack indices.

2. Perform the rearrangement: Iterate through the rearrangement procedure, and for each step, move the specified number of crates from the source stack to the destination stack. To do this, use a loop that iterates the specified number of times, and in each iteration, pop the top crate from the source stack and append it to the destination stack.

3. Find the top crates: After performing the rearrangement, iterate through the stacks and find the top crate in each stack. You can do this by simply accessing the last element of each inner list representing a stack.

4. Combine the top crates: Concatenate the top crates' labels to form the final message. You can do this using a string join operation or by iterating through the top crates and appending their labels to a result string.

5. Return the final message: Return the combined message as the final output.

For the given example, the final message would be "CMZ" after following these steps.

You must solve  using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is already stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

Store the examples in a `const examples: string[]`. Your solution should first run the examples and print the answers to the console.

Your solution should print console.log statements to help me understand what is happening as the code runs.

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer:

```typescript
// main.ts
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {

    }
  }

  return [stacks, moves];
};

const rearrangeCrates = (
  stacks: string[][],
  moves: [number, number, number][]

  for (const [numCrates, fromStack, toStack] of moves) {
    console.log(`Moving ${numCrates} crates from stack ${fromStack + 1} to stack ${toStack + 1}`);

const [stacks, moves] = parseInput(puzzleInput);
console.log('Puzzle stacks:', stacks);
console.log('Puzzle moves:', moves);

console.log('\n', answer);

To run the code, save it as `main.ts` and create a `./data/puzzleInput.txt` file with the puzzle input. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```
deno run --allow-read main.ts

};

const rearrangeCrates = (

This solution first runs the examples and prints the answers to the console. It also includes console.log statements to help you understand what is happening as the code runs. Finally, it prints the answer to the puzzle on a new line.

Make sure to update the `parseInput` function to correctly parse the move steps, and update the `rearrangeCrates` function to handle the moves properly.

# solveFailedPrompt:

Here is an solution that produces the wrong answer.

Here's an updated solution using Deno and TypeScript that should produce the correct answer:

```typescript
// main.ts
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const examples: string[] = [
  `    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
`,
];

const parseInput = (input: string): [string[][], [number, number, number][]] => {
  const lines = input.trim().split('\n');
  const stacks: string[][] = [];
  const moves: [number, number, number][] = [];

  for (const line of lines) {
    if (line.includes('[')) {
      const stackLine = line.split(' ').filter((s) => s !== '');
      for (let i = 0; i < stackLine.length; i += 2) {
        const stackIndex = parseInt(stackLine[i + 1]) - 1;
        const crate = stackLine[i].slice(1, -1);
        if (!stacks[stackIndex]) stacks[stackIndex] = [];
        stacks[stackIndex].push(crate);
      }
    } else {
      const moveParts = line.split(' ');
      moves.push([
        parseInt(moveParts[1]),
        parseInt(moveParts[5]) - 1,
        parseInt(moveParts[7]) - 1,
      ]);
    }
  }

  return [stacks, moves];
};

const rearrangeCrates = (
  stacks: string[][],
  moves: [number, number, number][]
): string => {
  for (const [numCrates, fromStack, toStack] of moves) {
    for (let i = 0; i < numCrates; i++) {
      const crate = stacks[fromStack].pop()!;
      stacks[toStack].push(crate);
    }
  }

  const topCrates = stacks.map((stack) => stack[stack.length - 1]);
  return topCrates.join('');
};

for (const example of examples) {
  const [stacks, moves] = parseInput(example);
  console.log('Example stacks:', stacks);
  console.log('Example moves:', moves);
  const result = rearrangeCrates(stacks, moves);
  console.log('Example result:', result);
}

const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
const [stacks, moves] = parseInput(puzzleInput);
console.log('Puzzle stacks:', stacks);
console.log('Puzzle moves:', moves);
const answer = rearrangeCrates(stacks, moves);
console.log('\n', answer);
```

To run the code, save it as `main.ts` and create a `./data/puzzleInput.txt` file with the puzzle input. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```
deno run --allow-read main.ts
```

This solution first runs the examples and prints the answers to the console. It also includes console.log statements to help you understand what is happening as the code runs. Finally, it prints the answer to the puzzle on a new line.

Make sure to update the `parseInput` function to correctly parse the move steps, and update the `rearrangeCrates` function to handle the moves properly.

Here was the output from running it:

stdout:
Example stacks: []
Example moves: [
  [ 1, NaN, 2 ],
  [ NaN, NaN, NaN ],
  [ 1, 0, NaN ],
  [ 3, 2, NaN ],
  [ 2, 0, NaN ],
  [ 1, 1, NaN ]
]

Please provide a full, updated solution in Deno and Typescript.
