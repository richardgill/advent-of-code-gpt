Here is a coding problem:

The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.

The ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.

The Elves don't want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.

They do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:

    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2

In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.

Then, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:

[D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:

        [Z]
        [N]
    [C] [D]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3

Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved one at a time, crate C ends up below crate M:

        [Z]
        [N]
[M]     [D]
[C]     [P]
 1   2   3

Finally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:

        [Z]
        [N]
        [D]
[C] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

The Elves just need to know which crate will end up on top of each stack; in this example, the top crates are C in stack 1, M in stack 2, and Z in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message CMZ.

After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?


Please explain 3 different approaches you could use to solve  the problem. For each approach explain how the solution works and break the small steps involved.

assistant: 

Approach 1: Simulation
1. Parse the input to create a list of stacks, where each stack is a list of crates.
2. Iterate through the rearrangement procedure, and for each step, perform the specified move by popping the crates from the source stack and appending them to the destination stack.
3. After all the steps are completed, iterate through the list of stacks and get the top crate (last element) of each stack.
4. Combine the top crates to form the final message.

Approach 2: Reverse Simulation
1. Parse the input to create a list of stacks, where each stack is a list of crates.
2. Reverse the rearrangement procedure, so that we can work backwards from the final configuration to the initial configuration.
3. Iterate through the reversed rearrangement procedure, and for each step, perform the reverse move by popping the crates from the destination stack and appending them to the source stack.
4. After all the steps are completed, iterate through the list of stacks and get the top crate (last element) of each stack.
5. Combine the top crates to form the final message.

Approach 3: Tracking Crate Movements
1. Parse the input to create a list of stacks, where each stack is a list of crates.
2. Create a dictionary to store the current position (stack and index) of each crate.
3. Iterate through the rearrangement procedure, and for each step, update the position of the crates in the dictionary according to the specified move.
4. After all the steps are completed, iterate through the list of stacks and use the dictionary to find the top crate of each stack.
5. Combine the top crates to form the final message.

All three approaches involve simulating the rearrangement procedure in some way, either by directly simulating the moves, working backwards from the final configuration, or tracking the movements of each crate. The main difference between the approaches is how they handle the rearrangement procedure and how they determine the top crate of each stack at the end.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution using the first approach (Simulation) with Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
// Import required modules
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

// Read input file
const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');

// Parse input
const [stacksInput, ...movesInput] = input.trim().split('\n');

const stacks = stacksInput
  .split(' ')
  .map((stack) => stack.split('').reverse());

// Perform rearrangement procedure
for (const move of movesInput) {
  const [_, count, from, _, to] = move.split(' ');
  const sourceStack = parseInt(from) - 1;
  const destStack = parseInt(to) - 1;
  const numCrates = parseInt(count);

  for (let i = 0; i < numCrates; i++) {
    const crate = stacks[sourceStack].pop();
    stacks[destStack].push(crate);
  }
}

// Get top crates and form the final message
const topCrates = stacks.map((stack) => stack[stack.length - 1]);
const answer = topCrates.join('');

console.log('\n', answer);
```

This solution reads the input file, parses the stacks and moves, simulates the rearrangement procedure, and then prints the final message.

const topCrates = stacks.map((stack) => stack[stack.length - 1]);
const answer = topCrates.join("");

console.log("\n", answer);
