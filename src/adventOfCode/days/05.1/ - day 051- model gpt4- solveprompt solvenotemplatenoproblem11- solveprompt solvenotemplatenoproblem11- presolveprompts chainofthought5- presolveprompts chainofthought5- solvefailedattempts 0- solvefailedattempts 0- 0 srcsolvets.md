Here is a coding problem:

The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.

The ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.

The Elves don't want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.

They do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:

    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2

In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.

Then, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:

[D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:

        [Z]
        [N]
    [C] [D]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3

Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved one at a time, crate C ends up below crate M:

        [Z]
        [N]
[M]     [D]
[C]     [P]
 1   2   3

Finally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:

        [Z]
        [N]
        [D]
[C] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

The Elves just need to know which crate will end up on top of each stack; in this example, the top crates are C in stack 1, M in stack 2, and Z in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message CMZ.

After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?


Please explain an approach you could use to solve  the problem. Explain how the solution works and break the small steps involved.

To solve this problem, we can use a simulation approach. We will simulate the rearrangement procedure step by step and keep track of the state of the stacks at each step. At the end of the simulation, we can simply read the top crates of each stack to get the answer. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Parse the input: First, we need to parse the input to get the initial state of the stacks and the rearrangement procedure. We can represent the stacks as lists of strings (crates) and the rearrangement procedure as a list of tuples (number of crates to move, source stack, destination stack).

2. Initialize the stacks: Create a list of lists to represent the stacks. Each list will contain the crates in the corresponding stack, with the bottom crate at index 0 and the top crate at the last index.

3. Simulate the rearrangement procedure: Iterate through the rearrangement steps and perform the following actions for each step:
   a. Pop the specified number of crates from the source stack.
   b. Append the popped crates to the destination stack in the same order they were popped.
   Note that we need to reverse the order of the popped crates before appending them to the destination stack, as the first crate to be moved should end up below the others.

4. Read the top crates: After simulating the rearrangement procedure, the top crates of each stack will be at the last index of each list. Concatenate the top crates to form the final answer.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def rearrange_crates(stacks, rearrangement_steps):
    # Initialize the stacks
    stacks = [list(stack) for stack in stacks]

    # Simulate the rearrangement procedure
    for num_crates, src, dest in rearrangement_steps:
        # Pop the crates from the source stack
        crates_to_move = [stacks[src - 1].pop() for _ in range(num_crates)]

        # Append the crates to the destination stack in the correct order
        stacks[dest - 1].extend(reversed(crates_to_move))

    # Read the top crates and concatenate them to form the answer
    top_crates = ''.join(stack[-1] for stack in stacks)
    return top_crates
```

Example usage:

```python
stacks = [['Z', 'N'], ['M', 'C', 'D'], ['P']]
rearrangement_steps = [(1, 2, 1), (3, 1, 3), (2, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2)]

result = rearrange_crates(stacks, rearrangement_steps)
print(result)  # Output: 'CMZ'
```

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution to the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

1. Create a new file named `rearrangeCrates.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
type RearrangementStep = [number, number, number];

function rearrangeCrates(stacks: string[][], rearrangementSteps: RearrangementStep[]): string {
  // Initialize the stacks
  stacks = stacks.map(stack => [...stack]);

  // Simulate the rearrangement procedure
  for (const [numCrates, src, dest] of rearrangementSteps) {
    // Pop the crates from the source stack
    const cratesToMove = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numCrates; i++) {
      cratesToMove.push(stacks[src - 1].pop());
    }

    // Append the crates to the destination stack in the correct order
    stacks[dest - 1].push(...cratesToMove.reverse());
  }

  // Read the top crates and concatenate them to form the answer
  const topCrates = stacks.map(stack => stack[stack.length - 1]).join('');
  return topCrates;
}

export { rearrangeCrates, RearrangementStep };
```

2. Create a new file named `main.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import { rearrangeCrates, RearrangementStep } from './rearrangeCrates.ts';
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const parseInput = (input: string): [string[][], RearrangementStep[]] => {
  const lines = input.trim().split('\n');
  const stacks = lines.slice(0, 3).map(line => line.split(' '));
  const rearrangementSteps = lines.slice(4).map(line => {
    const [_, numCrates, __, src, ___, dest] = line.split(' ');
    return [parseInt(numCrates), parseInt(src), parseInt(dest)] as RearrangementStep;
  });
  return [stacks, rearrangementSteps];
};

const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
const [stacks, rearrangementSteps] = parseInput(input);
const answer = rearrangeCrates(stacks, rearrangementSteps);

console.log('\n', answer);
```

3. Create a folder named `data` in the same directory as `main.ts` and save the puzzle input as `puzzleInput.txt` inside the `data` folder.

4. Run the solution using Deno:

```bash
deno run --allow-read main.ts
```

This will print the answer to the puzzle on a new line.
