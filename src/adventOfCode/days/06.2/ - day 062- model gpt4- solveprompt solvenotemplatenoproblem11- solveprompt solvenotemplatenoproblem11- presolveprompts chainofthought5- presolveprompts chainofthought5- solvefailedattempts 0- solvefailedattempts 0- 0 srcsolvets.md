## preSolvePrompt: 0

Here is a coding problem:

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.

However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?

Your puzzle answer was 1766.
--- Part Two ---

Your device's communication system is correctly detecting packets, but still isn't working. It looks like it also needs to look for messages.

A start-of-message marker is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it consists of 14 distinct characters rather than 4.

Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the above examples:

    mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb: first marker after character 19
    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 23
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 23
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 29
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 26

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?

## completion 1 
assistant: 

To solve part 2 of the problem, we can modify the subroutine we created in part 1 to detect a start-of-message marker instead of a start-of-packet marker. The main difference is that we now need to look for a sequence of 14 distinct characters instead of 4.

Here's an approach to solve part 2:

1. Initialize a variable `position` to 0. This variable will keep track of the current position in the datastream buffer.

2. Create a sliding window of size 14. Initialize the window with the first 14 characters of the datastream buffer.

3. Check if all characters in the sliding window are distinct. If they are, we have found the first start-of-message marker, and we can return the value of `position` + 14.

4. If the characters in the sliding window are not distinct, move the sliding window one character to the right (i.e., remove the first character and add the next character from the datastream buffer). Increment the `position` variable by 1.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until we find the first start-of-message marker or reach the end of the datastream buffer.

Here's a more detailed explanation of how the solution works:

- The sliding window is a data structure that allows us to efficiently process the datastream buffer by only considering a fixed-size subset of characters at a time. In this case, the window size is 14, which corresponds to the length of a start-of-message marker.

- By moving the sliding window one character at a time, we can efficiently check for the presence of a start-of-message marker in the datastream buffer. This is because we only need to check if the new character added to the window is distinct from the other characters, as we have already checked the distinctness of the previous characters in the window.

- When we find a start-of-message marker, we return the value of `position` + 14, which corresponds to the number of characters processed before the marker is detected. This is because the `position` variable keeps track of the starting position of the sliding window, and we need to add 14 to account for the length of the marker itself.

- If we reach the end of the datastream buffer without finding a start-of-message marker, we can return an appropriate error value or message to indicate that no marker was found.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve part 2 of the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution for part 2 of the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const findStartOfMessageMarker = (datastream: string, markerLength: number): number => {
  let position = 0;

  while (position + markerLength <= datastream.length) {
    const window = datastream.slice(position, position + markerLength);
    const uniqueChars = new Set(window);

    if (uniqueChars.size === markerLength) {
      return position + markerLength;
    }

    position++;
  }

  return -1; // No marker found
};

const main = () => {
  const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
  const markerLength = 14;
  const answer = findStartOfMessageMarker(puzzleInput, markerLength);
  console.log('\n', answer);
};

main();
```

This solution follows the approach explained earlier, with some modifications to make it work with Deno and TypeScript:

- We import the necessary modules from Deno's standard library to read the puzzle input from a file.

- We define the `readRelativeInput` function to read the puzzle input from the specified file. This function takes the import URL and input file name as arguments and returns the contents of the file as a string.

- We define the `findStartOfMessageMarker` function to find the first start-of-message marker in the datastream buffer. This function takes the datastream and marker length as arguments and returns the number of characters processed before the marker is detected.

- In the `main` function, we read the puzzle input, call the `findStartOfMessageMarker` function with the input and marker length, and print the answer to the console.

To run the solution, save the code in a file named `solution.ts` and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
deno run --allow-read solution.ts
```

  const filePath = path.join(dirname, "data", inputFile);

};

const findStartOfMessageMarker = (
  datastream: string,
  markerLength: number,
): number => {
  let position = 0;

  while (position + markerLength <= datastream.length) {
    const window = datastream.slice(position, position + markerLength);
    const uniqueChars = new Set(window);

    if (uniqueChars.size === markerLength) {
      return position + markerLength;
    }

    position++;
  }

  return -1; // No marker found
};

const main = () => {
  const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, "puzzleInput.txt");
  const markerLength = 14;
  const answer = findStartOfMessageMarker(puzzleInput, markerLength);
  console.log("\n", answer);
};
