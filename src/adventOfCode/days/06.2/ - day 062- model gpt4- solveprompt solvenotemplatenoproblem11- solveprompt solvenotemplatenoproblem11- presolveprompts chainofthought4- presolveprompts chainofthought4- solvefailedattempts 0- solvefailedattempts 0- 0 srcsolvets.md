Here is a coding problem:

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.

However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?


Please explain 3 different approaches you could use to solve part 2 of the problem. For each approach explain how the solution works and break the small steps involved.

Please explain 3 different approaches you could use to solve part 2 of the problem. For each approach explain how the solution works and break the small steps involved.

assistant: 

Approach 1: Brute Force
1. Initialize a variable `position` to store the position of the first start-of-packet marker.
2. Iterate through the datastream buffer using a for loop with an index variable `i`.
3. For each character, check if the previous three characters are all different from the current character and from each other.
4. If the condition in step 3 is met, set the `position` variable to `i+1` (since the position is 1-indexed) and break the loop.
5. Return the `position` variable as the result.

This approach is simple and straightforward, but it may not be the most efficient solution, especially for very long datastream buffers.

Approach 2: Sliding Window
1. Initialize a variable `position` to store the position of the first start-of-packet marker.
2. Initialize a variable `window` to store the last four characters in the datastream buffer.
3. Iterate through the datastream buffer using a for loop with an index variable `i`.
4. For each character, update the `window` by removing the first character and appending the current character.
5. Check if all characters in the `window` are different from each other.
6. If the condition in step 5 is met, set the `position` variable to `i-2` (since the position is 1-indexed) and break the loop.
7. Return the `position` variable as the result.

This approach is more efficient than the brute force approach, as it only checks the last four characters at each step, reducing the number of comparisons needed.

Approach 3: Using a Set
1. Initialize a variable `position` to store the position of the first start-of-packet marker.
2. Initialize a variable `unique_chars` to store the unique characters in the last four characters of the datastream buffer.
3. Iterate through the datastream buffer using a for loop with an index variable `i`.
4. For each character, update the `unique_chars` set by removing the character at position `i-4` (if it exists) and adding the current character.
5. Check if the size of the `unique_chars` set is equal to 4.
6. If the condition in step 5 is met, set the `position` variable to `i-2` (since the position is 1-indexed) and break the loop.
7. Return the `position` variable as the result.

This approach is similar to the sliding window approach, but it uses a set to store the unique characters in the last four characters of the datastream buffer, making it easier to check if all characters are different.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve part 2 of the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution using Deno and TypeScript with the sliding window approach:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const findFirstMarkerPosition = (datastream: string): number => {
  let window = datastream.slice(0, 4);

  for (let i = 4; i < datastream.length; i++) {
    window = window.slice(1) + datastream[i];

    if (
      window[0] !== window[1] &&
      window[0] !== window[2] &&
      window[0] !== window[3] &&
      window[1] !== window[2] &&
      window[1] !== window[3] &&
      window[2] !== window[3]
    ) {
      return i - 2;
    }
  }

  return -1;
};

const main = () => {
  const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
  const answer = findFirstMarkerPosition(puzzleInput);
  console.log('\n', answer);
};

main();
```

This code first imports the necessary modules and defines the `readRelativeInput` function. Then, it defines the `findFirstMarkerPosition` function, which implements the sliding window approach to find the position of the first start-of-packet marker in the datastream buffer. Finally, the `main` function reads the puzzle input, calls the `findFirstMarkerPosition` function, and prints the answer.

  let window = datastream.slice(0, 4);

  for (let i = 4; i < datastream.length; i++) {
    window = window.slice(1) + datastream[i];

    if (

    ) {
      return i - 2;
    }
  }

  return -1;
};

const main = () => {
  const puzzleInput = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, "puzzleInput.txt");
  const answer = findFirstMarkerPosition(puzzleInput);
  console.log("\n", answer);
};

main();
