Here is a coding problem:

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.

However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?

As an AI language model, I don't have access to the specific problem statement you are referring to. However, based on the problem description you provided, I can suggest some general steps to solve part 2 of the problem:

1. Create a buffer to store the received characters and initialize a counter to keep track of the number of characters processed so far.

2. Iterate through the input datastream, adding each character to the buffer and incrementing the counter.

3. Check if the buffer has at least four characters. If not, continue iterating through the datastream.

4. If the buffer has at least four characters, check if the last four characters are all different. If they are, return the current value of the counter, which represents the number of characters processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected.

5. If the last four characters are not all different, remove the first character from the buffer and continue iterating through the datastream.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different and report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve part 2 of using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`


Your solution should print console.log statements to help me understand what is happening as the code runs.

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Sure, here's a possible solution to part 2 of the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}

const findStartOfPacket = (datastream: string): number => {
  let buffer = ''
  let counter = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < datastream.length; i++) {
    buffer += datastream[i]
    counter++
    if (buffer.length >= 4) {
      const lastFour = buffer.slice(-4)
      if (new Set(lastFour).size === 4) {
        console.log(`Found start-of-packet marker at position ${counter - 4}`)
        return counter - 4
      } else {
        buffer = buffer.slice(1)
      }
    }
  }
  console.log('No start-of-packet marker found')
  return -1
}

const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt')
console.log('Input:', input)

const answer = findStartOfPacket(input)
console.log('\nAnswer:', answer)
```

Here's how the code works:

1. The `readRelativeInput` function takes the URL of the current module and the name of the input file as arguments, and returns the contents of the input file as a string. It uses the `path` module from the Deno standard library to construct the path to the input file relative to the current module.

2. The `findStartOfPacket` function takes a datastream string as input and returns the position of the first start-of-packet marker, or -1 if no such marker is found. It uses a buffer to store the last four characters seen so far, and a counter to keep track of the number of characters processed. It iterates through the datastream, adding each character to the buffer and incrementing the counter. If the buffer has at least four characters, it checks if the last four characters are all different. If they are, it returns the position of the start-of-packet marker (which is four characters before the current position). If not, it removes the first character from the buffer and continues iterating. If the end of the datastream is reached without finding a start-of-packet marker, it returns -1.

3. The main program reads the input file using `readRelativeInput`, and logs the input to the console for debugging purposes.

4. The main program calls `findStartOfPacket` with the input datastream, and logs the position of the start-of-packet marker (if found) or a message indicating that no marker was found.

5. The main program prints the answer to the puzzle (i.e., the position of the start-of-packet marker) to the console.

You can run this code using the following command:

```
deno run --allow-read mod.ts
```

Make sure to replace `mod.ts` with the name of the file where you save the code. Also, make sure to grant the `--allow-read` permission to Deno so that it can read the input file.

const result = findStartOfPacket(input.trim())
console.log(result)
```

This solution reads the input datastream from a file using the `readRelativeInput` function, which takes the URL of the current module and the name of the input file as arguments. It then calls the `findStartOfPacket` function, which iterates through the datastream, adding each character to a buffer and checking if the last four characters are all different. If they are, it returns the current value of the counter, which represents the number of characters processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected. If no marker is found, it returns -1.

To run the solution, you can save it to a file (e.g. `index.ts`) and run it using the following command:

```
deno run --allow-read index.ts
```

Make sure to replace `index.ts` with the name of the file you saved the solution to, and `--allow-read` allows the script to read the input file.
