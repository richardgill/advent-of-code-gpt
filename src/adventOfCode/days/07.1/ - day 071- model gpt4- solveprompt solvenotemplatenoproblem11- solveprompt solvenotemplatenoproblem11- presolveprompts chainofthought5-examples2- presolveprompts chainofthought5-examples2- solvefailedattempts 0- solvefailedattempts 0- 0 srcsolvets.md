Here is a coding problem:

You can hear birds chirping and raindrops hitting leaves as the expedition proceeds. Occasionally, you can even hear much louder sounds in the distance; how big do the animals get out here, anyway?

The device the Elves gave you has problems with more than just its communication system. You try to run a system update:

$ system-update --please --pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top
Error: No space left on device

Perhaps you can delete some files to make space for the update?

You browse around the filesystem to assess the situation and save the resulting terminal output (your puzzle input). For example:

$ cd /
$ ls
dir a
14848514 b.txt
8504156 c.dat
dir d
$ cd a
$ ls
dir e
29116 f
2557 g
62596 h.lst
$ cd e
$ ls
584 i
$ cd ..
$ cd ..
$ cd d
$ ls
4060174 j
8033020 d.log
5626152 d.ext
7214296 k

The filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and directories (which can contain other directories or files). The outermost directory is called /. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you're currently in.

Within the terminal output, lines that begin with $ are commands you executed, very much like some modern computers:

    cd means change directory. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument:
        cd x moves in one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named x and makes it the current directory.
        cd .. moves out one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory.
        cd / switches the current directory to the outermost directory, /.
    ls means list. It prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory:
        123 abc means that the current directory contains a file named abc with size 123.
        dir xyz means that the current directory contains a directory named xyz.

Given the commands and output in the example above, you can determine that the filesystem looks visually like this:

- / (dir)
  - a (dir)
    - e (dir)
      - i (file, size=584)
    - f (file, size=29116)
    - g (file, size=2557)
    - h.lst (file, size=62596)
  - b.txt (file, size=14848514)
  - c.dat (file, size=8504156)
  - d (dir)
    - j (file, size=4060174)
    - d.log (file, size=8033020)
    - d.ext (file, size=5626152)
    - k (file, size=7214296)

Here, there are four directories: / (the outermost directory), a and d (which are in /), and e (which is in a). These directories also contain files of various sizes.

Since the disk is full, your first step should probably be to find directories that are good candidates for deletion. To do this, you need to determine the total size of each directory. The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains, directly or indirectly. (Directories themselves do not count as having any intrinsic size.)

The total sizes of the directories above can be found as follows:

    The total size of directory e is 584 because it contains a single file i of size 584 and no other directories.
    The directory a has total size 94853 because it contains files f (size 29116), g (size 2557), and h.lst (size 62596), plus file i indirectly (a contains e which contains i).
    Directory d has total size 24933642.
    As the outermost directory, / contains every file. Its total size is 48381165, the sum of the size of every file.

To begin, find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000, then calculate the sum of their total sizes. In the example above, these directories are a and e; the sum of their total sizes is 95437 (94853 + 584). (As in this example, this process can count files more than once!)

Find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000. What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?


Please explain an approach you could use to solve  the problem. Explain how the solution works and break the small steps involved.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the filesystem tree and calculate the total size of each directory. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. Parse the input: First, we need to parse the input and create a tree-like data structure to represent the filesystem. We can use a dictionary to store the tree, where each key is a directory name and its value is a list of its children (files and directories). For files, we can store their sizes as well.

2. Depth-First Search (DFS): We will use a DFS algorithm to traverse the tree and calculate the total size of each directory. The DFS algorithm starts at the root directory and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. We can implement the DFS algorithm using recursion.

3. Calculate total size: During the DFS traversal, we will calculate the total size of each directory by adding the sizes of its files and the total sizes of its subdirectories. We will store the total size of each directory in a separate dictionary.

4. Filter directories: After calculating the total sizes of all directories, we will filter the directories with a total size of at most 100000.

5. Calculate the sum: Finally, we will calculate the sum of the total sizes of the filtered directories.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the solution:

1. Parse the input:
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `tree` to store the filesystem tree.
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `file_sizes` to store the sizes of the files.
   - Iterate through the input lines and parse the commands and output:
     - If the line starts with "cd", update the current directory.
     - If the line starts with "ls", parse the files and directories in the current directory and update the `tree` and `file_sizes` dictionaries accordingly.

2. Depth-First Search (DFS):
   - Create a helper function `dfs` that takes the current directory and its path as arguments.
   - If the current directory is a file, return its size.
   - If the current directory is a directory, initialize its total size to 0.
   - For each child in the current directory, call the `dfs` function recursively with the child and the updated path.
   - Add the returned size to the total size of the current directory.
   - Store the total size of the current directory in the `total_sizes` dictionary.
   - Return the total size of the current directory.

3. Calculate total size:
   - Call the `dfs` function with the root directory ("/") and an empty path.

4. Filter directories:
   - Iterate through the `total_sizes` dictionary and filter the directories with a total size of at most 100000.

5. Calculate the sum:
   - Calculate the sum of the total sizes of the filtered directories.

The final answer will be the sum of the total sizes of the directories with a total size of at most 100000.

Example 1:

Input:
```
$ cd /
$ ls
dir a
14848514 b.txt
8504156 c.dat
dir d
$ cd a
$ ls
dir e
29116 f
2557 g
62596 h.lst
$ cd e
$ ls
584 i
$ cd ..
$ cd ..
$ cd d
$ ls
4060174 j
8033020 d.log
5626152 d.ext
7214296 k
```

Output: 95437

Explanation: In this example, we have the following filesystem tree:

- / (dir)
  - a (dir)
    - e (dir)
      - i (file, size=584)
    - f (file, size=29116)
    - g (file, size=2557)
    - h.lst (file, size=62596)
  - b.txt (file, size=14848514)
  - c.dat (file, size=8504156)
  - d (dir)
    - j (file, size=4060174)
    - d.log (file, size=8033020)
    - d.ext (file, size=5626152)
    - k (file, size=7214296)

The directories with a total size of at most 100000 are a and e. The sum of their total sizes is 95437 (94853 + 584).

Example 2:

Input:
```
$ cd /
$ ls
dir a
dir b
$ cd a
$ ls
100000 c.txt
$ cd ..
$ cd b
$ ls
99999 d.txt
```

Output: 99999

Explanation: In this example, we have the following filesystem tree:

- / (dir)
  - a (dir)
    - c.txt (file, size=100000)
  - b (dir)
    - d.txt (file, size=99999)

The only directory with a total size of at most 100000 is b. The sum of its total size is 99999.

Example 3:

Input:
```
$ cd /
$ ls
dir a
$ cd a
$ ls
dir b
$ cd b
$ ls
50000 c.txt
50000 d.txt
```

Output: 100000

Explanation: In this example, we have the following filesystem tree:

- / (dir)
  - a (dir)
    - b (dir)
      - c.txt (file, size=50000)
      - d.txt (file, size=50000)

The only directory with a total size of at most 100000 is b. The sum of its total size is 100000.

In each example, we would follow the same approach as described in the previous answer: parse the input, perform a DFS traversal to calculate the total size of each directory, filter the directories with a total size of at most 100000, and calculate the sum of their total sizes.

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's the solution using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
// Import path module from Deno standard library
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

// Read input file
const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

// Parse input
const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');
const lines = input.trim().split('\n');

// Initialize data structures
const tree: Record<string, any> = {};
const fileSizes: Record<string, number> = {};
const totalSizes: Record<string, number> = {};
let currentDir = '/';

// Parse input and build tree
for (const line of lines) {
  if (line.startsWith('$ cd')) {
    const [, dir] = line.split(' ');
    if (dir === '/') {
      currentDir = '/';
    } else if (dir === '..') {
      currentDir = path.dirname(currentDir);
    } else {
      currentDir = path.join(currentDir, dir);
    }
  } else if (line.startsWith('$ ls')) {
    const items = line.slice(4).split(' ');
    for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += 2) {
      const sizeOrDir = items[i];
      const name = items[i + 1];
      const fullPath = path.join(currentDir, name);
      if (sizeOrDir === 'dir') {
        tree[fullPath] = [];
      } else {
        const size = parseInt(sizeOrDir, 10);
        fileSizes[fullPath] = size;
        tree[currentDir].push(fullPath);
      }
    }
  }
}

// DFS function to calculate total size
function dfs(dir: string): number {
  if (fileSizes[dir] !== undefined) {
    return fileSizes[dir];
  }

  let totalSize = 0;
  for (const child of tree[dir]) {
    totalSize += dfs(child);
  }

  totalSizes[dir] = totalSize;
  return totalSize;
}

// Calculate total size of root directory
dfs('/');

// Filter directories with total size at most 100000
const filteredDirs = Object.entries(totalSizes).filter(
  ([_, size]) => size <= 100000
);

// Calculate sum of total sizes of filtered directories
const answer = filteredDirs.reduce((sum, [_, size]) => sum + size, 0);

// Print the answer
console.log('\n', answer);
```

This solution follows the same approach as described in the previous answers. It reads the input file, parses the input, builds the filesystem tree, calculates the total size of each directory using a DFS algorithm, filters the directories with a total size of at most 100000, and calculates the sum of their total sizes. Finally, it prints the answer to the console.
