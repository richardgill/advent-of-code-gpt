Here is a coding problem:

You avoid the ropes, plunge into the river, and swim to shore.

The Elves yell something about meeting back up with them upriver, but the river is too loud to tell exactly what they're saying. They finish crossing the bridge and disappear from view.

Situations like this must be why the Elves prioritized getting the communication system on your handheld device working. You pull it out of your pack, but the amount of water slowly draining from a big crack in its screen tells you it probably won't be of much immediate use.

Unless, that is, you can design a replacement for the device's video system! It seems to be some kind of cathode-ray tube screen and simple CPU that are both driven by a precise clock circuit. The clock circuit ticks at a constant rate; each tick is called a cycle.

Start by figuring out the signal being sent by the CPU. The CPU has a single register, X, which starts with the value 1. It supports only two instructions:

    addx V takes two cycles to complete. After two cycles, the X register is increased by the value V. (V can be negative.)
    noop takes one cycle to complete. It has no other effect.

The CPU uses these instructions in a program (your puzzle input) to, somehow, tell the screen what to draw.

Consider the following small program:

noop
addx 3
addx -5

Execution of this program proceeds as follows:

    At the start of the first cycle, the noop instruction begins execution. During the first cycle, X is 1. After the first cycle, the noop instruction finishes execution, doing nothing.
    At the start of the second cycle, the addx 3 instruction begins execution. During the second cycle, X is still 1.
    During the third cycle, X is still 1. After the third cycle, the addx 3 instruction finishes execution, setting X to 4.
    At the start of the fourth cycle, the addx -5 instruction begins execution. During the fourth cycle, X is still 4.
    During the fifth cycle, X is still 4. After the fifth cycle, the addx -5 instruction finishes execution, setting X to -1.

Maybe you can learn something by looking at the value of the X register throughout execution. For now, consider the signal strength (the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register) during the 20th cycle and every 40 cycles after that (that is, during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles).

For example, consider this larger program:

addx 15
addx -11

The interesting signal strengths can be determined as follows:

    During the 20th cycle, register X has the value 21, so the signal strength is 20 * 21 = 420. (The 20th cycle occurs in the middle of the second addx -1, so the value of register X is the starting value, 1, plus all of the other addx values up to that point: 1 + 15 - 11 + 6 - 3 + 5 - 1 - 8 + 13 + 4 = 21.)
    During the 60th cycle, register X has the value 19, so the signal strength is 60 * 19 = 1140.
    During the 100th cycle, register X has the value 18, so the signal strength is 100 * 18 = 1800.
    During the 140th cycle, register X has the value 21, so the signal strength is 140 * 21 = 2940.
    During the 180th cycle, register X has the value 16, so the signal strength is 180 * 16 = 2880.
    During the 220th cycle, register X has the value 18, so the signal strength is 220 * 18 = 3960.

The sum of these signal strengths is 13140.

Find the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles. What is the sum of these six signal strengths?

## completion 1

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Parse the input program into a list of instructions.
2. Initialize variables to keep track of the current cycle, the value of register X, and the sum of signal strengths.
3. Iterate through the instructions, updating the cycle count and register X value based on the instruction type (addx or noop).
4. At the specified cycle numbers (20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th), calculate the signal strength (cycle number * register X value) and add it to the sum of signal strengths.
5. Continue iterating through the instructions until the end of the program is reached.
6. Return the sum of the six signal strengths.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the solution:

1. Parse the input program:
   - Read the input program line by line.
   - For each line, split the line into words.
   - If the first word is "addx", create a tuple with the instruction type "addx" and the integer value of the second word.
   - If the first word is "noop", create a tuple with the instruction type "noop".
   - Append the tuple to a list of instructions.

2. Initialize variables:
   - Set the current cycle to 0.
   - Set the value of register X to 1.
   - Set the sum of signal strengths to 0.

3. Iterate through the instructions:
   - For each instruction in the list of instructions:
     - If the instruction type is "addx":
       - Increment the current cycle by 1.
       - Wait for one more cycle (as addx takes two cycles to complete).
       - Update the value of register X by adding the instruction value.
       - Increment the current cycle by 1.
     - If the instruction type is "noop":
       - Increment the current cycle by 1.

4. Calculate the signal strength at specified cycle numbers:
   - If the current cycle is one of the specified cycle numbers (20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th):
     - Calculate the signal strength by multiplying the current cycle number with the value of register X.
     - Add the signal strength to the sum of signal strengths.

5. Continue iterating through the instructions until the end of the program is reached.

6. Return the sum of the six signal strengths.

By following this approach, we can efficiently calculate the sum of the signal strengths at the specified cycle numbers.

Example 1:
Input:
```
noop
addx 3
addx -5
```
Output: 0

Explanation:
- During the 20th cycle, the program has already finished executing. The value of register X is -1 (1 + 3 - 5). The signal strength is 20 * (-1) = -20.
- There are no other specified cycle numbers in this example, so the sum of signal strengths is -20.
- However, since the program has already finished executing, the output should be 0.

Example 2:
Input:
```
addx 5
noop
addx -2
```
Output: 100

Explanation:
- During the 20th cycle, the program has already finished executing. The value of register X is 4 (1 + 5 - 2). The signal strength is 20 * 4 = 80.
- There are no other specified cycle numbers in this example, so the sum of signal strengths is 80.
- However, since the program has already finished executing, the output should be 0.

Example 3:
Input:
```
addx 10
noop
noop
addx -5
noop
noop
addx 5
```
Output: 420

Explanation:
- During the 20th cycle, the program is executing the last "addx 5" instruction. The value of register X is 6 (1 + 10 - 5). The signal strength is 20 * 6 = 120.
- During the 60th cycle, the program has already finished executing. The value of register X is 11 (1 + 10 - 5 + 5). The signal strength is 60 * 11 = 660.
- The sum of signal strengths is 120 + 660 = 780.
- However, since the program has already finished executing, the output should be 0.

In each example, we follow the same approach as described in the previous answer. We parse the input program, initialize variables, iterate through the instructions, calculate the signal strength at specified cycle numbers, and return the sum of the signal strengths. The only difference is that we need to check if the program has already finished executing before calculating the signal strength. If the program has finished executing, the output should be 0.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve  the problem using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's a solution to the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
// Import path module from Deno standard library
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts';

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl));
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile);
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath);
};

const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt');

type Instruction = ['addx', number] | ['noop'];

const parseInput = (input: string): Instruction[] => {
  return input.split('\n').map(line => {
    const [instruction, value] = line.split(' ');
    return instruction === 'addx' ? ['addx', parseInt(value)] : ['noop'];
  });
};

const sumSignalStrengths = (instructions: Instruction[]): number => {
  let cycle = 0;
  let registerX = 1;
  let sumSignalStrengths = 0;
  let instructionIndex = 0;

  while (cycle <= 220) {
    if (cycle === 20 || cycle === 60 || cycle === 100 || cycle === 140 || cycle === 180 || cycle === 220) {
      sumSignalStrengths += cycle * registerX;
    }

    const instruction = instructions[instructionIndex];
    if (instruction[0] === 'addx') {
      cycle++;
      if (cycle % 2 === 0) {
        registerX += instruction[1];
        instructionIndex++;
      }
    } else {
      cycle++;
      instructionIndex++;
    }
  }

  return sumSignalStrengths;
};

const instructions = parseInput(input);
const answer = sumSignalStrengths(instructions);
console.log('\n', answer);
```

This solution follows the approach explained in the previous answers. It first reads the input file using the provided `readRelativeInput` function. Then, it parses the input into a list of instructions using the `parseInput` function. The `sumSignalStrengths` function calculates the sum of the signal strengths at the specified cycle numbers. Finally, the answer is printed to the console.
