Here is a coding problem:

The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.

The ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.

The Elves don't want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.

They do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:

    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2

In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.

Then, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:

[D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:

        [Z]
        [N]
    [C] [D]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3

Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved one at a time, crate C ends up below crate M:

        [Z]
        [N]
[M]     [D]
[C]     [P]
 1   2   3

Finally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:

        [Z]
        [N]
        [D]
[C] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

The Elves just need to know which crate will end up on top of each stack; in this example, the top crates are C in stack 1, M in stack 2, and Z in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message CMZ.

After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?

Your puzzle answer was TPGVQPFDH.
--- Part Two ---

As you watch the crane operator expertly rearrange the crates, you notice the process isn't following your prediction.

Some mud was covering the writing on the side of the crane, and you quickly wipe it away. The crane isn't a CrateMover 9000 - it's a CrateMover 9001.

The CrateMover 9001 is notable for many new and exciting features: air conditioning, leather seats, an extra cup holder, and the ability to pick up and move multiple crates at once.

Again considering the example above, the crates begin in the same configuration:

    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

Moving a single crate from stack 2 to stack 1 behaves the same as before:

[D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

However, the action of moving three crates from stack 1 to stack 3 means that those three moved crates stay in the same order, resulting in this new configuration:

        [D]
        [N]
    [C] [Z]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3

Next, as both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1, they retain their order as well:

        [D]
        [N]
[C]     [Z]
[M]     [P]
 1   2   3

Finally, a single crate is still moved from stack 1 to stack 2, but now it's crate C that gets moved:

        [D]
        [N]
        [Z]
[M] [C] [P]
 1   2   3

In this example, the CrateMover 9001 has put the crates in a totally different order: MCD.

Before the rearrangement process finishes, update your simulation so that the Elves know where they should stand to be ready to unload the final supplies. After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?

1. Modify the data structure used to represent the stacks of crates to allow for multiple crates to be moved at once. This could be done by using a list or array to represent each stack, and allowing for a sublist or subarray to be moved between stacks.

2. Update the code that executes the rearrangement procedure to take into account the new ability to move multiple crates at once. This could be done by keeping track of the current position of each crate in the stack, and updating those positions as crates are moved.

3. After the rearrangement procedure is complete, determine the final order of the crates in each stack. This could be done by iterating through each stack and identifying the top crate based on its position in the stack.

4. Combine the top crates from each stack into a single string to represent the final order of the crates. This could be done by concatenating the top crate from each stack in the order of the stack numbers.

5. Output the final string of crates to the Elves so they know where to stand to unload the supplies.

You must solve part 2 of using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`


Your solution should print console.log statements to help me understand what is happening as the code runs.

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`

  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}

interface Stack {
  crates: string[]
  positions: number[]
}

const parseInput = (input: string): Stack[] => {
  const stacks: Stack[] = []
  const lines = input.trim().split('\n')
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const stack: Stack = { crates: [], positions: [] }
    const crates = lines[i].match(/\[(.*?)\]/g)
    for (let j = 0; j < crates.length; j++) {
      const crate = crates[j].replace(/\[|\]/g, '')
      stack.crates.push(crate)
      stack.positions.push(j)
    }
    stacks.push(stack)
  }
  return stacks
}

const moveCrates = (stacks: Stack[], from: number, to: number, count: number) => {
  const movedCrates = stacks[from].crates.slice(-count)
  const movedPositions = stacks[from].positions.slice(-count)
  stacks[from].crates.splice(-count)
  stacks[from].positions.splice(-count)
  stacks[to].crates.push(...movedCrates)
  stacks[to].positions.push(...movedPositions)
}

const simulateRearrangement = (stacks: Stack[], input: string) => {
  const lines = input.trim().split('\n')
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [countStr, fromStr, toStr] = lines[i].split(' ')
    const count = parseInt(countStr)
    const from = parseInt(fromStr) - 1
    const to = parseInt(toStr) - 1
    moveCrates(stacks, from, to, count)
  }
}

const getTopCrates = (stacks: Stack[]): string => {
  let result = ''
  for (let i = 0; i < stacks.length; i++) {
    const topIndex = stacks[i].positions.indexOf(stacks[i].positions.length - 1)
    result += stacks[i].crates[topIndex]

const stacks = parseInput(input)
simulateRearrangement(stacks, input)
const answer = getTopCrates(stacks)
console.log('\n', answer)
```

The code is similar to the solution for part 1, but with a few modifications to handle the ability to move multiple crates at once. The `Stack` interface now includes an array of `positions` to keep track of the current position of each crate in the stack. The `parseInput` function has been updated to populate the `positions` array based on the order of the crates in the input. The `moveCrates` function now takes a `count` parameter to specify how many crates to move, and updates both the `crates` and `positions` arrays accordingly.

The `simulateRearrangement` function is mostly the same as in part 1, but now calls `moveCrates` with the appropriate `count` parameter. The `getTopCrates` function has been updated to use the `positions` array to determine the top crate in each stack.

Finally, the code reads the input file, parses it into stacks of crates, simulates the rearrangement procedure, and outputs the final order of the crates.

The `Stack` interface now includes an array of `positions` to keep track of the current position of each crate in the stack. The `parseInput` function has been updated to populate the `positions` array based on the order of the crates in the input.

The main change is in the `moveCrates` function. When moving crates between stacks, we need to adjust the positions of the moved crates to account for their new position in the destination stack. We do this by subtracting the position of the first moved crate in the source stack, and adding the length of the destination stack to get the new position in the destination stack.

Finally, the code reads the input file, parses it into stacks of crates, simulates the rearrangement procedure, and outputs the final order of the crates.

# solveFailedPrompt:

Here is an solution that produces the wrong answer.

Here's an updated solution to part 2 of the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl: string, inputFile: string): string => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}

interface Stack {
  crates: string[]
  positions: number[]
}

const parseInput = (input: string): Stack[] => {
  const stacks: Stack[] = []
  const lines = input.trim().split('\n')
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const stack: Stack = { crates: [], positions: [] }
    const crates = lines[i].match(/\[(.*?)\]/g)
    for (let j = 0; j < crates.length; j++) {
      const crate = crates[j].replace(/\[|\]/g, '')
      stack.crates.push(crate)
      stack.positions.push(j)
    }
    stacks.push(stack)
  }
  return stacks
}

const moveCrates = (stacks: Stack[], from: number, to: number, count: number) => {
  const movedCrates = stacks[from].crates.slice(-count)
  const movedPositions = stacks[from].positions.slice(-count)
  stacks[from].crates.splice(-count)
  stacks[from].positions.splice(-count)
  stacks[to].crates.push(...movedCrates)
  stacks[to].positions.push(...movedPositions.map(p => p - movedPositions[0] + stacks[to].positions.length))
}

const simulateRearrangement = (stacks: Stack[], input: string) => {
  const lines = input.trim().split('\n')
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [countStr, fromStr, toStr] = lines[i].split(' ')
    const count = parseInt(countStr)
    const from = parseInt(fromStr) - 1
    const to = parseInt(toStr) - 1
    moveCrates(stacks, from, to, count)
  }
}

const getTopCrates = (stacks: Stack[]): string => {
  let result = ''
  for (let i = 0; i < stacks.length; i++) {
    const topIndex = stacks[i].positions.indexOf(stacks[i].positions.length - 1)
    result += stacks[i].crates[topIndex]
  }
  return result
}

const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt')
const stacks = parseInput(input)
simulateRearrangement(stacks, input)
const answer = getTopCrates(stacks)
console.log('\n', answer)
```

The code is similar to the solution for part 1, but with a few modifications to handle the ability to move multiple crates at once. The `Stack` interface now includes an array of `positions` to keep track of the current position of each crate in the stack. The `parseInput` function has been updated to populate the `positions` array based on the order of the crates in the input. The `moveCrates` function now takes a `count` parameter to specify how many crates to move, and updates both the `crates` and `positions` arrays accordingly.

The `simulateRearrangement` function is mostly the same as in part 1, but now calls `moveCrates` with the appropriate `count` parameter. The `getTopCrates` function has been updated to use the `positions` array to determine the top crate in each stack.

The main change is in the `moveCrates` function. When moving crates between stacks, we need to adjust the positions of the moved crates to account for their new position in the destination stack. We do this by subtracting the position of the first moved crate in the source stack, and adding the length of the destination stack to get the new position in the destination stack.

Finally, the code reads the input file, parses it into stacks of crates, simulates the rearrangement procedure, and outputs the final order of the crates.

Here was the output from running it:
