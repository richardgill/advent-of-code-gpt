Here is a coding problem:

The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.

Rock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.

Appreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. "The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column--" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.

The second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.

The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).

Since you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.

For example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:

A Y
B X
C Z

This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:

    In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).
    In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).
    The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.

In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).

What would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?


Please explain 3-5 small steps to solve  the problem. Show your reasoning and explain your answer.

1. Read the input: The first step is to read the input, which is the strategy guide provided by the Elf. The input contains pairs of characters, where the first character represents the opponent's move, and the second character represents the move that you should make in response.

2. Play the game: Once we have the strategy guide, we can start playing the game. We need to simulate each round of the game, where we choose our move based on the opponent's move according to the strategy guide. We can keep track of the score for each round and the total score.

3. Calculate the score: For each round, we need to calculate the score based on the moves made by both players. We can use the rules of the game to determine the outcome of each round and calculate the score accordingly. We can add the score for each round to the total score.

4. Output the result: Once we have played all the rounds and calculated the total score, we can output the result.

5. Test the solution: We can test the solution with different inputs to make sure it works correctly. We can also check the output against the expected result to verify the correctness of the solution.


# solvePrompt:

You must solve  using Deno and Typescript.

You can read files in Deno like this:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}
```

The puzzle input is stored at `./data/puzzleInput.txt`


Your solution should print console.log statements to help me understand what is happening as the code runs.

The last thing your solution should do is print the answer to the puzzle on a new line like this: `console.log('\n', answer)`


# answer: 

Here's the solution to the problem using Deno and TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.101.0/path/mod.ts'

const readRelativeInput = (importUrl, inputFile) => {
  const dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(importUrl))
  const filePath = path.join(dirname, 'data', inputFile)
  return Deno.readTextFileSync(filePath)
}

const input = readRelativeInput(import.meta.url, 'puzzleInput.txt')

const scoreMap = {
  'AR': 6,
  'AP': 0,
  'AS': 3,
  'BR': 3,
  'BP': 6,
  'BS': 0,
  'CR': 0,
  'CP': 3,
  'CS': 6,
}

let totalScore = 0

for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i += 3) {
  const opponentMove = input[i]
  const myMove = input[i + 2]
  const scoreKey = opponentMove + myMove
  const score = scoreMap[scoreKey]
  totalScore += score
  console.log(`Opponent move: ${opponentMove}, My move: ${myMove}, Score: ${score}`)
}

console.log('\n', totalScore)
```

Explanation:

1. We start by reading the input file using the `readRelativeInput` function.

2. We define a `scoreMap` object that maps each possible combination of moves to the corresponding score.

3. We loop through the input string, processing each round of the game. We extract the opponent's move and our move from the input string, and use them to look up the score in the `scoreMap` object. We add the score to the `totalScore` variable and print out the details of the round.

4. Finally, we print out the total score.

To run the solution, save the code in a file (e.g. `solution.ts`) and run the following command in the terminal:

```
deno run solution.ts
```

This should print out the details of each round and the total score.
